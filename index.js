// Arithmetic Operators

// JavaScript supports arithmetic operators for:

// + addition
// - subtraction
// * multiplication
// / division
// % modulo

//Multi-line Comments /* The below configuration must be changed before deployment*/
let baseUrl = 'localhost/taxwebapp/country';
//Remainder/Modulo Operator
const weeksInYear = Math.floor(365/7); //Calculate no. of weeks
const daysLeftOver = 365 % 7; //Calculate no. of days
console.log("A year has " + weeksInYear + " weeks and " + daysLeftOver + " days");
//Assignment Operators
//An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. Here are some of them:

// += addition assignment
// -= subtraction assignment
// *= multiplication assignment
// /= division assignment
let number = 100;
//Both statements will add 10 
number = number + 10;
number += 10;
console.log(number);

//String Interpolation : String interpolation is the process of evaluating string literals containing one or more 
//placeholders (expressions, variables, etc).

let age = 7;

//String concatenation
'Tommy is' + age + 'years old.';

//String interpolation
'Tommy is ${age} years old.';

//Variables : Variables are used whenever thereâ€™s a need to store a piece of data.

const currency = '$';
let userIncome = 85000;

console.log(currency + userIncome + ' is more than the average income.');

//Undefined
//undefined is a primitive JavaScript value that represents lack of defined value.

var a;
console.log(a);

//Learn Javascript: Variables
//A variable is a container for data that is stored in computer memory.

let name1 = "Tammy";
const found = false;
var age1 = 3;
console.log(name1, found, age1);
